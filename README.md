RAF - Ruby ALPC Fuzzer

This is a PoC. It will send traffic and produce lots of output on screen, but
is highly unlikely to find real bugs. You are encouraged to write an actual
fuzzer.

Test cases are generated by using ~3000 verses and notes from the works of
Chaucer and feeding them through radamsa.

```
